# Frontend Data Analysis

This project is a data analysis tool built with React and Vite. It aggregates and visualizes crop production data, displaying it in two interactive tables. The first table shows the data aggregated by year, and the second table shows the data aggregated by crop name over a period from 1950 to 2020.

## Features

- Aggregates crop production data by year.
- Displays the crop with maximum and minimum production for each year.
- Aggregates crop yield and cultivation area by crop name.
- Interactive tables with hover effects.
- Responsive and user-friendly UI using Mantine UI components.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Vite
- TypeScript
- Mantine (for UI components)
